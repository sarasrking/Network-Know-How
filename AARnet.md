# About AARNet

AARNet is a not-for-profit organisation owned by Australian universities and research institutions. We provide high speed network for universities to connect researchers. We also provide cloud storage, known as CloudStor, and other network services – anyone here ever used Zoom? Panopto? They are provided via AARNet services.

Today we are going to talk about networks and data movement. We’ll define these and help you be able to feel comfortable with these concepts.
