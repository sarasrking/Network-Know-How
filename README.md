# Network-Know-How
A workshop for researchers and research support staff

## Introduction

This workshop aims to help you feel more comfortable talking about networks, integrated tools, data and storage. You will learn about how these all fit into the researcher's toolkit. It is an introductory set of lessons for those who are brand new, or have little or no prior knowledge. By the end of the workshop you will have a good understanding of what networks are, network speed and latency, data movement, cloud storage and collaborative research tools. You will be able to do some jargon busting, perform some basic tasks and help provide solutions to some data movement scenarios.
