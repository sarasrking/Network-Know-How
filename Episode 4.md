# FACTORS AFFECTING DATA MOVEMENT

## Network speed

One of the key factors in data movement is network speeds. These speeds can be affected by different issues, such as time of day and physical interference. 

Take a look at these websites that address some of the factors that affect network speeds:

* Time of day - https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/internet-landline-services/broadband-speeds (go to section 'Network limitations that affect speed')
* Physical interference - https://www.performancenetworks.co.uk/blog/post/5-factors-can-affect-wifi-signal/

Remember from the previous section that there are ways you can test the speed of the network before you begin moving data, and you can use an online calculator to help you work out how long your data movement will take.

There are several concepts to consider when thinking about data movement. Let's take a look at these one at a time:

* Bandwidth or throughput (bps) - size of the “pipe” for data to flow in (the successful data transfer rate in bits per second) 
* Latency (ms) - time (or delay) measured in milliseconds in sending data between two points   
* Speed - bandwidth and latency (the amount of data that can be received every second)  
* Packet loss - failure of a packet of data to reach its destination  
* Hop - path between networking devices (on a network)  
* Hop count - number of devices (routers) on a network between start/end points
 
Activity
 
Search through the CloudStor knowledgebase on the AARNet website to get tips on data transfer using FileSender, WebDAV, the Sync and ownCloud clients, Rocket the data pump tool and the Collections plugin.

# DATA MOVEMENT TOOLS
 
## WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
 
WebDAV is an extension to HTTP, the protocol that web-browsers and webservers use to communicate with each other. The WebDAV protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver too, supporting collaborative authoring of web content.
 
WebDAV extends the set of standard HTTP methods and headers to provide the ability to create a file or folder, edit a file in place, copy or move or delete a file, etc.
 
## Rocket
 
What Is CloudStor Rocket?
 
CloudStor Rocket is a fast parallel upload tool to help researchers upload datasets from scientific instrumentation to CloudStor.
 
It has the following benefits:
Standalone Windows application
Upload only, different to the CloudStor sync client that mirrors data
Allows tuning/tweaking to help upload your data as quickly as possible.
 
### Activity
 
Data movement scenarios - divide into groups and take on a challenge!
 
1. Dr David Hasselfish
 
Marine scientist
Data profile: autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) (512GB storage card) and hyperspectral satellite images (60-200GB) 
Project profile: sea floor scans quarterly, by the beach for 2 years
Data movement problem:
How best can Dr Hasselfish transfer the different files from the different data sources?  
Manging AUV data: 
How big are sea floor scans and can 1000 files fit in the 512 GB card? That determines how often to retrieve storage card, if needed, or can it be upload using Rocket?
Combine data into packages from storage card to transmit to CloudStor via WebDAV
Managing Satellite image data:
Where are these stored? Transmit to CloudStor as received via WebDAV.

Constraint:
1000s files output from the AUV and a few (big) images generated by a satellite service. 
 
2. Dr M. Meldrummer
 
Performance studies
Data profile:  1TB raw audio, 3TB raw video, 60GB images
Project profile: capture of a one-off live performance
Data movement problem:
How best should Dr Meldrummer get the data into cloud storage?  
Constraint:
The data has been sent on three hard-drives and there are ~1000 of files. 
 
 
VERY large data - Moving data that is very large, e.g. petabyte scale, across networks is the working terrain of network specialists within institutions and networking experts working within the national and international NREN community (e.g. REANNZ and AARNet).
