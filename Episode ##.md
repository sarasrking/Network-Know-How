title: "Calculating file transfer time"
teaching: 15
exercises: 2
questions:
- How do you calculate how long it will take to move a file or group of files?
objectives:
- Discuss the differences between network speeds and file transfer times
- Compare differences with two different file sizes
- Calculate a file transfer time
keypoints:
- Moving files or data can take time! But you can potentially save time by checking your options before you start.

# File transfer times

Now let's take a look at some samples of data transfer times according to which network you are on and how you are connected:

## 100MB Transfer

100MB is an average maximum file size for an email attachment. Take a look at this table to see the differences in transfer times depending on network and connection type.

Network type | Connection speed	| Transfer time
------------ | ---------------- | -------------
At home on poor ADSL |	3.38 Mbps	| 7 minutes
At a conference, using wifi |	54 Mbps	| 17 seconds
On the NBN	| 100 Mbps | 8 seconds
On the NREN	| 10 Gbps |	milliseconds

Note: The download and upload speeds of the advanced research network are the same and the speeds are significantly greater. Remember that ADSL and NBN speeds are different, favouring download over upload.

Time can be saved if the network speeds are tested ahead of trying to transfer data, network traffic levels are known, and file sizes have been calculated. 

#### Activity 1

How would you (or would you recommend a researcher) undertake a data transfer process? 
What do you need to consider when thinking about the network they are using? 
Did you know that the time of day at both the point of departure AND the point of arrival can have an influence on network speeds?

## 100TB Transfer

Now let's compare the file transfer speeds of a 100TB of data. This time we'll include the national research and education network (NREN) at a couple of different speeds.

Network type | Connection speed	| Transfer time
------------ | ---------------- | -------------
At home on poor ADSL |	3.38 Mbps	| 4973 days
At a conference, using wifi |	54 Mbps	| 199 days
On the NBN	| 100 Mbps | 101 days
On the NREN	| 10 Gbps |	1 day
On the NREN | 40 Gbps | 46 minutes
On the NREN | 100 Gbps | 18 minutes

Note: Research data collections are now growing into the multi terabyte and petabyte scale. These multi-gigabit flows of data (known as 'elephant flows') generated by data-intensive research fields are carried globally across research network infrastructure, avoiding congestion of the commercial internet (eg NBN).
