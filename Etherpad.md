## How to run the workshop

### Library Carpentries

This workshop is presented in Library Carpentry style.

Library Carpentry is a way of teaching and learning about data and software in library environments. It’s a slow-paced, hands-on method that is intended to be inclusive and encouraging.

## Etherpad

Part of the collaborative learning space we are aiming to create is using an [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/).

Etherpad allows you to edit documents collaboratively in real-time, much like Google Docs. We have access to versions too, these are automatically saved so don’t panic if you accidentally delete something!

Use the template to create one for this class and add the link to this slide, or write it on the board. You can create a [tiny.cc](https://tiny.cc/) link if that helps! Share this link with the class so that they can have it open as you run the workshop and contribute where appropriate. You can also show this on a large screen in front of the class.
