# About AARNet

AARNet, Australia's Academic Research Network, is a not-for-profit organisation owned by Australian universities and research institutions. AARNet provides high speed network for universities to connect researchers. It also provides cloud storage, known as CloudStor, and other network services – anyone here ever used Zoom? Panopto? They are provided via AARNet services.
