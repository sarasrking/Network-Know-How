# JARGON BUSTING
 
This exercise is an opportunity to begin to ask questions and to get a firmer grasp on the concepts around networks, data, storage and digital tools in research.
 
## Activity
 
In pairs, look at the list of terms here:
 
 Network
 Infrastructure
 Bandwidth
 Latency
 Upload/Download
 Response time
 Ping
 Traceroute
 Speedtest
 Hop
 Data movement
 Cloud storage
 Computational notebook
 Literate programming
 Mbps/Gbps
 NBN
 NREN
 Headroom
 
Are you familiar with these terms in this context? What are the ones that trip you up? Think of a way to remember what that word or term means in this context that might help others understand it better. How could you define a term (or two!) above to make it easier to understand? Write your definitions down here - we can add to this list as we go and keep it as a resource for the future:
 
eg Latency - the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer. See this page for more: [http://www.plugthingsin.com/internet/speed/latency/](http://www.plugthingsin.com/internet/speed/latency/)
