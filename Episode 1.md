title: "Jargon Busting"
teaching: 15
exercises: 1
questions:
- What do these terms mean in this context?
objectives:
- Talk about terms used when talking about networks and data movement
- Create a list of definitions for the group to use and learn from
keypoints:
- Let's get comfy! It's important to unpack these terms so we all know what we mean and can feel more confident talking about networks and data movement.

# JARGON BUSTING
 
This exercise is an opportunity to begin to ask questions and to get a firmer grasp on the concepts around networks, data, storage and digital tools in research.
 
## Activity
 
In pairs, look at the list of terms below:

- Network
- Infrastructure
- Bandwidth
- Latency
- Upload/Download
- Response time
- Ping
- Traceroute
- Speedtest
- Hop
- Data movement
- Cloud storage
- Computational notebook
- Literate programming
- Mbps/Gbps
- NBN
- NREN
- Headroom

Are you familiar with these terms in this context? What are the ones that trip you up? Think of a way to remember what that word or term means in this context that might help others understand it better. How could you define a term (or two!) above to make it easier to understand? Write your definitions down (you can include links) - we can add to this list on the etherpad as we go and keep it as a resource for the future:
 
eg Latency - the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer.

## Some useful definitions for this workshop:

**Network**

A network, in computing, is a group of two or more devices that can communicate. In practice, a network is comprised of a number of different computer systems connected by physical and/or wireless connections. The scale can range from a single PC sharing out basic peripherals to massive data centers located around the world, to the Internet itself. Regardless of scope, all networks allow computers and/or individuals to share information and resources.

Computer networks serve a number of purposes, some of which include:

●	Communications such as email, instant messaging, chat rooms, etc.

●	Shared hardware such as printers and input devices

●	Shared data and information through the use of shared storage devices

●	Shared software, which is achieved by running applications on remote computers

**Data movement**

Data movement, also known as data transfer or data transmission is the process of using computing techniques and technologies to transmit or transfer electronic or analog data from one computer node to another. Data is transferred in the form of bits and bytes over a digital or analog medium, and the process enables digital or analog communications and its movement between devices.
