## Comaparative Scale of Bytes

Measurement | Abbreviation | Equivalent | Description
----------- | ------------ | ---------- | -----------
Byte | B | - | Basic unit of measurement
Kilobyte | KB | 1000 B | One page of text = 30KB
Megabyte | MB | 1000 KB | A piece of music = 5MB
Gigabyte | GB | 1000 MB | A two-hour film = 1 GB
Terabyte | TB | 1000 GB | 6 million books = 1 TB
Petabyte | PB | 1000 TB | A stack of DVDs as tall as a 55-storey building = 1 PB
Exabyte | EB | 1000 PB | All the information generated up to 2003 = 5 EB
Zettabyte | ZB | 1000 EB | All the data recorded in 2011 = 1.8 ZB
Yottabyte | YB | 1000 ZB | Storage capacity of the NSA datacentre in Utah (92000m sq, in 2013) = 1 YB
